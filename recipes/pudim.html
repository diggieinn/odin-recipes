    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This traditional Brazilian dessert is a type of creamy, caramel-coated custard flan. Although there are as many
        variations on the dessert as there are families in Brazil (and throughout Latin America), the standard
        ingredients of pudim de leite condensado include sweetened condensed milk, regular whole milk, eggs, and sugar.
    </p>


    <p>To make the custard, the condensed milk mixture is typically poured into round molds or cake pans that have been
        coated with a simple caramel sauce, before it is baked in a water bath until it’s become firm and set. According
        to popular belief, this simple dessert is thought to have evolved from an old Portuguese dish known as pudim de
        priscos, an invention that has been attributed to a certain Portuguese priest named Manuel Joaquim Machado, also
        known as Father Priscos. </p>


    <p>Earlier versions of pudim de leite condensado used whole milk instead of condensed milk, which made the entire
        process of making the dessert much more complicated and time-consuming. The present version of the pudding was
        born after condensed milk was introduced in the country, back in the early 19th century.


    <p>This silky custard flan is usually enjoyed chilled and cut into wedges, and it is commonly served plain. Typical
        accompaniments to this dessert include whipped cream, berries, and fruit.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Condensed milk</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Make the Caramel: In a saucepan, melt sugar over low heat until it turns a golden brown. Quickly pour the
            caramel into a round baking dish, tilting to coat the bottom evenly. Be careful, as the caramel will be very
            hot.
        </li>
        <li>Blend the Ingredients: In a blender, combine condensed milk, fresh milk, eggs, and vanilla extract. Blend
            until smooth and well mixed.
        </li>
        <li>Pour into the Mold: Carefully pour the blended mixture over the set caramel in the baking dish.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in a Water Bath: Place the baking dish in a larger oven-safe dish filled with hot water. Bake at 350°F
            (175°C) for about 1 hour, or until the pudim is set and a toothpick inserted comes out clean.
        </li>
        <li>Cool and Refrigerate: Once baked, remove from the oven and let it cool to room temperature. Refrigerate for
            a few hours or overnight for the best texture.
        </li>
        <li>Serve: To serve, run a knife around the edges of the pudim and invert it onto a serving plate. The caramel
            will flow beautifully over the top, creating an irresistible presentation.
        </li>
    </ol>
