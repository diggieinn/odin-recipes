        Brigadeiro

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Brigadeiro is a decadent Brazilian dessert made by heating three key ingredients together - unsalted butter,
        cocoa powder, and condensed milk, which are then rolled into a small ball, similar in shape to a truffle. First
        made in the 1940s, when fruit and sweets were in short supply, brigadeiro was born out of creativity with just a
        few ingredients.
    </p>
    <p>According to one legend, Brigadeir Eduardo Gomes was running for presidency in 1945 with a slogan that said "Vote
        for Brigadeir, he's handsome and single". The slogan won over a lot of girls who baked and sold the sweets in
        order to raise funds for Brigadeir's campaign.
    </p>
    <p>Whether the story is true or not, today it is impossible to find a birthday party in Brazil without these
        chocolate sweets. Brigadeiros are very sweet, with a rich chocolate flavor, and are usually topped with
        chocolate sprinkles. Today, they are marketed as a gourmet delicacy, made in many different flavors such as
        almond, mint, hazelnut, coffee, and coconut.
    </p>
    <p>A source of national pride, it is said that if you make brigadeiro for someone who is feeling bad, there are good
        chances that it will make them smile.
    </p>


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Cocoa</li>
        <li>Condensed Milk</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Chocolate sprinkles</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Place the sweetened condensed milk, chocolate chips, and 1 tbsp butter in a small saucepan.
        </li>
        <li>Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring non-stop. Cook the mixture for about 10 minutes, until it’s thick
            and you can see the bottom of the pan. If you run the spoon through the middle of the pan, it should take
            about 5 seconds for the mixture come back together. The longer you cook, the thicker it will be.
        </li>
        <li>When you pick up a spatula full of the dough, watch the way it falls back into the pan, it should fall into
            chunks, not in a stream.
        </li>
        <li>It might take a couple of tries to figure out the best consistency for rolling. If you want to use it to
            fill cakes, you can keep the consistency of the dough a bit softer, but if you want to roll them, you want
            to cook it enough to make it stiffer, otherwise the fudge balls won’t hold up.
        </li>
        <li>Once you get to the desired consistency, pour the dough into a small bowl. Place it in the fridge until
            completely cool.
        </li>
        <li>Now rub a bit of butter over your hands.
        </li>
        <li>Use a spoon to scoop small amounts of brigadeiro, and roll into a ball between lightly buttered hands.
        </li>
        <li>Coat into sprinkles and place in a small paper cup.
        </li>
        <li>Here is a great tip to get the brigadeiros in the perfect round shape. After coating it in sprinkles, shake
            the ball against your cupped hand, this will give the brigadeiro a nice round shape. I demonstrate how to do
            this on the video.
        </li>
    </ol>
